## How Open Source Foundations Are Funded

Open source is built by individuals from around the world.  While some are volunteers, students, or hobbyists, many are paid developers working for software vendors, consultants, or integrators.  

On the organizational side, many popular projects join FOSS Foundations - typically non-profit organizations that serve as an independent home or fiscal sponsor for the project.  Most Foundations handle legal, IP, fundraising, and infrastructure services for projects; other Foundations do more.

This site is being built as a resource for those wishing to research funding questions around FOSS Foundations.
