## How Does Open Source Get Funding?

Open source is built by individuals from around the world.  While some are volunteers, students, or hobbyists, many are paid developers working for software vendors, consultants, or integrators.  

On the organizational side, many popular projects join FOSS **Foundations** - typically non-profit organizations that serve as an independent home or fiscal sponsor for the project.  Most Foundations handle legal, IP, fundraising, and infrastructure services for projects; other Foundations do more.  Many other projects are independent, or are hosted by a company or just by an individual with a website.  [Read FOSS Sustainability](https://fosssustainability.com/) for more ideas about keeping open source projects health.
