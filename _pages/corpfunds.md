Some technology-related companies have "FOSS Funds", where they pledge a pool of funding they give directly to open source projects they rely on.  Some programs are defined by management; other programs allow their employees to vote on which projects to fund in a specific period.  Many programs provide a set amount of grants each year, quarter, or month.  Some [corporations feature their funds on the FOSSFunders site](https://fossfunders.com/), which is another great resource.

Note that many software companies also *sponsor* various FOSS Foundations, providing funding or services at a higher level for foundation operations or passthrough to hosted projects; see [FOSS Foundation Sponsorships models and numbers](https://fossfoundation.info/sponsorships).
