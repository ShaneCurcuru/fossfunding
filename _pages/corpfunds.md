Some technology-related companies have "FOSS Funds", where they pledge a pool of funding they give directly to open source projects they rely on.  Some programs are defined by management; other programs allow their employees to vote on which projects to fund in a specific period.  Many programs provide a set amount of grants each year, quarter, or month. 

Note that many software companies also sponsor various FOSS Foundations, providing funding at a higher level for foundation operations or passthrough to hosted projects; for more data there, see [FOSS Foundation Sponsorships](https://fossfoundation.info/sponsorships).
